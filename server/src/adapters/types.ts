/**
 * SNIPER Integration Hub — adapter catalog & driver contracts.
 *
 * Every external provider SNIPER can talk to is described by an AdapterDef in
 * the catalog below. A driver implementation (mock / digitap / pending) turns
 * an integration row + an input into a normalized AdapterResult. The CRM never
 * depends on a provider's raw response shape — mappers normalize per adapter.
 *
 * SECURITY: no secret ever lives in an AdapterDef / integration row. Credentials
 * are read from the process environment only (server/.env, git-ignored).
